## 607 Assignment 3B Dylan Gold

# Approach
In this assignment we have to work with a data set that has time series.
We have to find/generate a data set then use sql or dplyr to calculate the average from year to year, as well as every 6 days
I will find something online, maybe ask a LLM to generate one or give me ideas.

I will likely get the data as a csv onto github then use dplyr to create these averages after importing the data into R
