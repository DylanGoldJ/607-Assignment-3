Input: Give me a dataset that has time series for two or more separate items.



Here’s a small, clean example time series dataset with two separate items: Product A and Product B.
This format works well for forecasting, trend analysis, and visualization.

If you’d like, I can also provide:

📈 A larger dataset (multiple years)

🏬 Multiple stores × multiple products

📉 Dataset with seasonality + trend + noise

🧠 Dataset formatted for machine learning (wide format)

🐍 Python code to generate synthetic time series data

Just tell me your use case 😊



Input: Since 2022, Real, quantitative items




Here are some real, quantitative time-series data sources that include multiple items (variables) and cover periods including/after 2022 — suitable for analysis, modeling, or forecasting:

📈 1. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

A very large database of economic time series from official U.S. sources — includes multiple quantitative variables over time such as GDP, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, monetary aggregates, etc. All series are regularly updated and many run through 2025 or later.

✔️ Covers many variables
✔️ Data from 2022 onward available
✔️ Updated regularly

Example use:

Date	Unemployment Rate	CPI Inflation	10-yr Treasury Yield	…
2022-01-31	4.0	7.5	1.78	…
2022-02-28	3.8	7.9	1.83	…
…	…	…	…	…

(Above table is illustrative.)
🔗 FRED data is downloadable via API or CSV.

🦠 2. COVID-19 Daily Cases & Deaths

The COVID-19 time series dataset on GitHub tracks daily cases, deaths, and recoveries by country — and continues into 2025 via maintained repositories.

✔️ Daily counts for multiple countries
✔️ Useful for comparative time-series

Example format:

Date	Country	Confirmed	Deaths	Recovered
2022-01-01	US	180,000	2,500	80,000
2022-01-01	Brazil	150,000	3,000	75,000
…	…	…	…	…

(Note: format common across countries.)

📊 3. ECB Data Portal Time Series

The European Central Bank (ECB) publishes various economic time series such as farm-gate prices, banknote statistics, market prices, etc., with data series updated through 2025.

✔️ Real numeric economic series
✔️ Can be multiple series (e.g., price indices, transaction flows)

📙 4. Our World in Data Time Series

While not a single dataset, the Our World in Data project compiles many time series across domains (e.g., health, energy, climate, economics). Many series include data for multiple quantitative variables over time extending through recent years (including 2022–2025).

Examples include:

Global CO₂ emissions

Vaccination rates

Energy consumption indicators

GDP per capita, population
… and more.

📁 5. Real-Time Data Set — U.S. Real Economic Indicators

The Real-Time Data Set published by the Federal Reserve provides real quarterly or monthly series for real GDP, real consumption, investment, net exports, etc., often updated with vintage data.

✔️ Multiple real economic measures
✔️ Time series updated monthly

📦 How You Might Receive These Datasets

Most sources let you download directly or via API. For example:

FRED: API returns CSV/JSON for multiple series

COVID-19 GitHub: raw CSV files (daily values per country)

ECB Data Portal: bulk CSV/SDMX downloads

Our World in Data: CSV downloads per topic

If you want, I can write Python or R code to retrieve and combine several of these time series into a single dataset (e.g., GDP + CPI + unemployment since 2022) — just tell me which variables you’re interested in!
