Give me data set, csv, timeseries daily, real

ChatGPT said:

Sure — I can provide a real daily time-series dataset in CSV format, but I need one clarification first:

👉 What kind of daily time-series data do you want?
Examples:

    COVID cases

    Weather (temperatures, precipitation)

    Stock prices (e.g., AAPL)

    Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)

    Exchange rates (USD/EUR)

    Air quality

    Energy prices

    Economic indicators (e.g., unemployment claims)

    Other

Please tell me:

    The topic or variable you want,

    The date range (e.g., 2020-01-01 to 2025-01-01),

    Any specific location (if relevant).

Once I have that, I’ll fetch a real dataset, convert it to CSV, and share it with you.

Energy Consumption NY 2022 to 2026

ChatGPT said:

Here’s how you can get a real daily time-series dataset of energy consumption/load for New York State (2022–2026) — including ready-to-download CSV files:
📊 1. NYISO Daily Electricity Load (Actual Consumption)

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) publishes historical electricity load data (which is essentially the energy consumption of the grid) with daily granularity.
➡️ The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) hosts this data as CSV files.
Daily Actual Load CSVs

You can directly download the daily energy consumption (load) data for New York from the EIA’s repository:

    NYISO Hourly Actual Load CSVs (includes date/time and load values by zone) — these can be aggregated to daily totals.

👉 For a direct CSV link (example for 2024 load):

    nyiso_load_act_hr_2024.csv — contains hourly measurements which you can sum by date to get daily consumption totals.

You can access other years similarly by replacing the year in the URL format:

https://www.eia.gov/electricity/wholesalemarkets/csv/nyiso_load_act_hr_YYYY.csv

(Replace YYYY with 2022, 2023, 2025, etc.)
📁 2. ElectricityMaps Daily Data (up to 2024)

The ElectricityMaps platform also provides daily CSVs (for New York ISO) with already-processed daily load data which is easier to use:

    Historical daily load datasets (2021–2024) are available in CSV format after creating a free account.

If you sign up on ElectricityMaps and download the “NYISO Latest daily” dataset, you’ll get a daily timeseries of electricity consumption by date (kW or MW).
🛠️ 3. How to Build Your CSV (2022–2026 Daily)

Since official state datasets with full date coverage aren’t available directly for all years in one file, you can assemble a daily dataset yourself:
Steps

    Download hourly datasets from EIA for years 2022–2025 using the URL pattern above.

    Aggregate hourly load to daily totals using a tool like Excel, Python, or R (sum all hours per date).

    For 2026, use the most recent EIA load CSV available — if not yet published, you can update later.

    Save the aggregated results into a single CSV with columns like:

Date,Energy_Load_MW
2022-01-01,XXXX
2022-01-02,XXXX
...
2026-02-14,XXXX

📌 Notes & Sources

    The EIA NYISO Hourly Actual Load CSVs can serve as the raw source for daily energy consumption timeseries.

    ElectricityMaps provides easy CSV downloads for daily data (but requires a free account).

    New York state energy profiles (annual totals) exist in NYSERDA reports, but not at daily resolution.

📥 Example CSV Snippet (Daily Load)

Below is a tiny example of how the final daily CSV might look — this is fictional sample data for illustration:

Date,NYISO_Daily_Load_MW
2022-01-01,31025
2022-01-02,29834
2022-01-03,30567
...
2025-12-31,32590
2026-01-01,32110

If you’d like, I can help you generate a ready-to-download CSV by aggregating the hourly load data for specific years (e.g., 2022–2025) — just tell me which years and whether you want peak load, average load, or total daily energy.
